# ARTIFICIAL RETAIL SALES CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION DASHBOARD
# Situation
For this project, I leveraged a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle to analyze order processing efficiency for a fictional e-commerce business. The dataset included key details such as order dates, ship dates, customer segments, and product categories. The primary goal was to identify patterns and bottlenecks in the shipping process, specifically focusing on the time taken to fulfill orders. By calculating the difference between order and ship dates, I was able to uncover insights into shipping delays and performance across different customer segments and regions.
# Task
The task involved analyzing a Kaggle-provided e-commerce dataset to assess and improve the order fulfillment process. I was tasked with calculating the time taken between order placement and shipping, identifying delays, and uncovering patterns in shipping performance across different customer segments, regions, and product categories. This required a deep dive into the data to extract actionable insights that could guide strategies for enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. My goal was to deliver a comprehensive analysis that would enable the business to streamline its shipping processes and improve overall customer experience.
# Action
To achieve the project's objectives, I utilized Power BI and SQL to perform a thorough analysis of the dataset. First, I used SQL to extract and clean the relevant data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. I then imported the data into Power BI, where I created calculated columns and measures, including calculating the days between order placement and shipping. I built interactive dashboards that visualized key metrics, such as shipping times across customer segments and regions. These visualizations allowed for easy identification of patterns, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement, providing actionable insights to enhance the order fulfillment process.The preview of the dashboard is available below.

# Result
The dashboard has been a tremendous success, providing valuable insights into the progress of customer segmentation program , delays and general business as well.
Some of the quantifiable results of the project include:
- Results from the dashboard shows that half of the orders are being returned by customers.
- Results shows that there is lots of losses experienced, an average of ($6.08K).
- Results shows there is wide gap of delays in customer orders ,an average of 180 days before receiving.
- Results shows that in all customers segments,there is alot of losses experienced,wide gap of delays and number of returned orders.
- Results shows that technology and furniture categories experience lots of losses except office supplies that showed profit.
- All sub categories experience delays,number of returned orders and lots of losses.Only Bookcases showed an average profits among all but still experience delays and number of returned orders.
